# SMWLV-metrics

This repository is a place to store notebooks that define and collect metrics for SMWLV science cases.

Before pushing changes to notebooks, please make sure to restart the kernel and clear output in the notebook, then run all cells.  This is to avoid getting merge conflicts from cells being run in different orders.
